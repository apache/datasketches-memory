/**
 * The original design provided the MemoryRequestServer callback only for Memory segments allocated via
 * <i>WritableMemory.allocateDirect(...)</i> calls.  Memory segments allocated via
 * <i>WritableMemory.wrap(ByteBuffer)</i> did not have this capability.  This was a major oversight since
 * all off-heap memory in Druid is allocated using ByteBuffers!  It is unusual that no one has
 * uncovered this until August 2021.  Nonetheless, the fix involves instrumenting all the paths involved
 * in providing this callback mechanism for wrapped ByteBuffers.
 *
 * This issues was first identified in Druid Issue #11544 and then posted as DataSketches-java Issue #358.
 * But the actual source of the problem was in Memory.
 *
 * This test mimics the Druid issue but at a much smaller scale.
