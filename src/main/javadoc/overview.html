<h2>Memory</h2> 
<h3>Overview</h3>
Provides high performance access to native memory for primitives and primitive arrays. Also provides compatible views into heap-based arrays and the Java ByteBuffer class. This package is general purpose, has no external dependencies and can be used in any application that needs to manage data structures outside the Java heap.

<p>Note: If the requirements or promises of any method's contract are not fulfilled (that is, if there is a bug in either the method or its caller), then an unchecked exception will be thrown. The precise type of such an unchecked exception does not form part of any method's contract.</p>
